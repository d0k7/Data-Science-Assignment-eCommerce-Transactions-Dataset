Customer Analytics Assignment - EDA, Lookalike Model & Clustering

Overview

This project involves three key data-driven tasks:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Understanding customer and transaction data to derive business insights.

2. Lookalike Model - Recommending similar customers based on profile and transaction history.

3. Customer Segmentation (Clustering) - Grouping customers using clustering techniques for business strategy optimization.

Task Breakdown

Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Business Insights

>Performed detailed EDA on customer, product, and transaction data.

>Extracted key business insights related to customer behavior, spending patterns, and regional trends.

>Delivered insights in a structured PDF report.

Task 2: Lookalike Model

>Built a machine learning model using customer and transaction data.

>Utilized Nearest Neighbors algorithm to find the top 3 similar customers for each of the first 20 customers.

>Generated a Lookalike.csv file with recommended lookalike customers and similarity scores.

Task 3: Customer Segmentation (Clustering)

>Applied clustering algorithms to group customers based on transaction and profile data.

>Evaluated clusters using DB Index and selected the optimal number of clusters.

>Visualized customer segments with relevant plots for better business understanding.
